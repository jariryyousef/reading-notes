![list](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5e46ef60397c182fec255f32_02_14_2020/lists.png)
- Ordered lists: are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number

example :

` <ol>  `  
  `<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>`  
 ` <li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20 minutes until tender</li>`  
 `<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>`  
 `<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>`  
 `<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>`  
 `</ol> `  


- Unordered lists: are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order)
example:  

`<ul>`  
`  <li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>`  
`  <li>100ml milk</li> `  
` <li>50g salted butter</li> `  
` <li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>`  
`  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>`  
`</ul>`
