### - What is a function in JS?
A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output  

### - How do you declare a function?
You can declare a function by providing its return value, name, and the types for its arguments. The names of the arguments are optional. A function definition counts as a function declaration.

### -example:

`var x = myFunction(4, 3);   // Function is called, return value will end up in x`

`function myFunction(a, b) {`
 ` return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b`
`} `
