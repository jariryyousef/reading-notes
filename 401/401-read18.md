## Cryptography

- One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies. The Caesar Cipher is a great introduction to encryption, decryption, and code cracking, thanks to its simplicity.

### Cryptography terminology

- Encryption is scrambling the data according to a secret key
- Decryption is recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key

## Caesar cipher

- In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques

### Cracking the cipher

- There are three main techniques to crack the cipher which are:

  - Frequency analysis: analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely character and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that

  - Known plaintext: is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker has access to both the plaintext, and its encrypted version

  - Brute force: for Caesar Cipher The enemy could take some time to try out each of them and find one that yielded a sensible message for just the first word or two.
