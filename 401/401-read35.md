# Graphs
- A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### Undirected Graphs
- An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
### Directed Graphs (Digraph)
- A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.


### Complete Graphs
- A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
### Connected
- A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

### Disconnected

- A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.


### Acyclic 
- In addition to undirected and directed graphs, we also have acyclic and cyclic graphs.
### Cyclic Graphs
- A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

- A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
