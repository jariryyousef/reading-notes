## Create a Next.js App

- To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store. A framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

## Next.js: The React Framework

Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

## Setup

If you don’t have Node.js installed, install it from here. You’ll need Node.js version 10.13 or later.

### Create a Next.js app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

    - cd nextjs-blog

    - yarn create next-app --example with-tailwindcss Name-of-your-app

    - npx create-next-app name-of-your-app --use-npm --example

### Run the development server

cd nextjs-blog npm run dev

#### Editing the starter Page

##### Download Starter Code (Optional)

`npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/tree/master/navigate-between-pages-starter"`

### Image Component

import Image from 'next/image'

`const YourComponent = () => ( <Image src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio alt="Your Name" /> )`

#### Writing and Importing CSS

    - CSS and Sass (import .css and .scss files)
    - Tailwind CSS

#### Restart the Development Server

`npm run dev`


### What is React context?

- React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.

In other words, React context allows us to share data (state) across our components more easily.


### When should you use React context?
- React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application.

- These types of data include:

1- Theme data (like dark or light mode)  
2- User data (the currently authenticated user)  
3- Location-specific data (like user language or locale)
