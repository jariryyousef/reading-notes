## List Comprehensions:

* **List comprehensions** provide a concise way to create lists.It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.

* The **list comprehension** always returns a result list.

* The **list comprehension** starts with a ‘[‘ and ‘]’,square brackets, to help you remember that the result is going to be a list.

* The basic syntax uses square brackets:

``` 
[ expression for item in list if conditional ]
```

* This is equivalent to:

```
for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression  
```

## Primer on Decorators:

*  **Decorator** is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.
 
* In Python functions are first-class objects. This means that functions can be passed around and used as arguments, just like any other object (string, int, float, list, and so on).

* It’s possible to define functions inside other functions. Such functions are called inner functions.
