## Unit tests and TDD?

Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

## What does the if **name** == “**main**”: do?

If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special **name** variable to have a value “**main**”. If this file is being imported from another module, **name** will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to **name** global variable.

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.

## What is Recursion?
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.
