### What is Git and why it is used?  
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

### What exactly is GitHub?
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project

### Is git safe to use?

Git is precisely as secure as every other file with the same ownership on whatever computer it's on. Git is accessed through http or ssh; in the case of http it's up to the server to provide whatever access control you want.

### How do I start Git?
- Create a directory to contain the project.
- Go into the new directory.
- Type git init .
- Write some code.
- Type git add to add the files (see the typical use page).
- Type git commit .
